# randomchat

A new Flutter project.
# first commit
so the app as the name suggests is a random chat (will almost random) app 
the ui of this app is almost done with minor changes for the future 
the ui is almost the same as the tictactoe project ui 
mainly because this app is nothing but me getting to know more about 
node js and mongo DB and i want to delive in more in that aspect and not the ui.

# second commit 
in the previous commit you could not add the prefrence typed in the text field instead 
my name would appear but now the text added to the text field will be displayed in the chip below 
also now you can click on the chip and it will show a dialog to confirm deletion process 
the deletion process wil be local and not database related since the data will be stored 
after clicking the create room button.

# 3rd commit 
created a node server and mongo DB connection as will as socket io connection
