# randomchat

A new Flutter project.
# first commit
so the app as the name suggests is a random chat (will almost random) app 
the ui of this app is almost done with minor changes for the future 
the ui is almost the same as the tictactoe project ui 
mainly because this app is nothing but me getting to know more about 
node js and mongo DB and i want to delive in more in that aspect and not the ui.
